        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Inspiration</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The inspiration behind this app stems from{' '}
          <strong>Akshay Saini‚Äôs Namaste React</strong> series, a powerful
          learning resource that showcases how to build modern, scalable web
          applications using React. Namaste Foodie integrates many best
          practices from the series, including the use of hooks, context, and
          Redux Toolkit to build a performance-driven, scalable app.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How it Works</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Namaste Foodie works by integrating with Swiggy‚Äôs API to fetch
          restaurant data. The app uses a proxy to handle CORS issues, and Redux
          to manage the cart functionality. Restaurants are displayed based on
          user location, and the app supports lazy loading for optimal
          performance. You can browse restaurant menus, add or remove items
          to/from your cart, and experience seamless navigation between pages.
        </p>
